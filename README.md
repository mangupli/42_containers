# 42_containers

The project where we had to re-implement the data structures and their iterators of the standart library c++98:

- Vector
- Map
- Stack

This project is aimed for:

1. To improve the skills of object-oriented programming on c++
2. To study thoroughly how the basic data structures work because you had to face the same problems of building them as the developers of the standart library
3. To get familiar with the red-black tree which is a bad-ass
4. To write your unit-tests
